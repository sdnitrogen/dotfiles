# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles which are the config files I use to customize my dev environments. These files help memaintain a consistent setup across different machines when setting up a new environment.

## Essential Tools

- **Main Terminal**: [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)
- **Shell Prompt**: [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- **Color Theme**: All themes are based on the [Tokyo Night color palette](https://github.com/tokyo-night)
